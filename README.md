# Jupyter Lab and Forecasting

These notebooks contain code related to prediction using Prophet and HW. <br>
In the "Info" folder you will find a very useful link to understand how you can take your first steps. <br>
In my case, it was useful for a larger project that I have saved in another repository "Prophet_Forecasting".<br>
